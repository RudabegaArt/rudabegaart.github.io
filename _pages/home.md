# Biography
Chris Nalty is a New York based oil painter. He began showing in 2025 in Addison, Maine and New York City.

His surreal works focus on creating allegorical depictions of our world. They feature strange creatures and robed figures in familiar settings. These settings are often mundane scenes that would appear normal if not for the unusual figures. This juxtaposition invites the viewer to reflect on themselves

Nalty’s still lifes take on an explorative lens. He uses them to experiment on every aspect of painting: brushwork, composition, abstraction, sizing and surface. His works maintain a recognizable body through the strong separation of light and shadow that drive his compositions.

Chris has appeared in group shows including “Baker National”, Baldwin City 2026, “Predominately Black”, New York 2025, and “Schoodic Schoolhouse Annual Show”, Addison 2025.
